# leaflet-challenge



The code creates a Leaflet map centered at coordinates (0, 0) with a zoom level of 2.


It fetches earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed.


For each earthquake, it creates a circle marker whose size is based on the magnitude and color is based on the depth.


Popups provide additional information about each earthquake when the markers are clicked.
